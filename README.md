# Historic Postal Data
Open historic data created from Benjamin Franklin's Philadelphia post office records in the collections of the American Philosophical Society.

## What is this data?
Benjamin Franklin was appointed Postmaster of Philadelphia in 1737, and a long and fruitful career in the postal service followed. The records created during his tenure, however, have not been objects of much study. The original volumes (Mss.B.F85.misc) from which these spreadsheets were made are in the collections of the American Philosophical Society and can be viewed in the APS Digital Library:
* Post Office Book, 1748-52  [<a href="https://diglib.amphilsoc.org/islandora/object/compound:11">APS Digital Library link</a>] - *This volume of 372 pages records receipt and dispatch of all mail in the Philadelphia Post Office between May 25, 1748 and July 23, 1752. Deliveries into the Post Office from out of town were listed, letter by letter, by the names of the addressees, weight and amount due, paid or free. Outgoing mail was simply listed by number of sheets and weight, not by individual letters.*
* Post Office Record Book No. 3, 1748 [<a href="https://diglib.amphilsoc.org/islandora/object/compound:55">APS Digital Library link</a>] - *"Post Office Accounts drawn out Nov. 1743" is a small volume of ca. 50 pages. It contains a list of names with amounts due with notes as to letters delivered, paid, etc. The names are abstracted from Post Office Ledger, No. 2.*
* Post Office Accounts, 1748 [<a href="https://diglib.amphilsoc.org/islandora/object/compound:54">APS Digital Library link</a>] - *"Post Office Accounts" May 18, 1748, is the continuation of the above ledger [No. 3]. It contains 68 pages.*
* Post Office Book (letters received), 1767-68  [<a href="https://diglib.amphilsoc.org/islandora/object/compound:53">APS Digital Library link</a>] - *These printed forms were filled in in manuscript and list the letters received from other colonial post offices or from ships in the Philadelphia Post Office by Postmaster Thomas Foxcroft.*
