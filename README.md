# Historic-Postal-Data
Data from Philadelphia post office record book, 1748-1752.

## About this Dataset
  This dataset is created from a volume of 372 pages that records receipt and dispatch of all mail in the Philadelphia Post Office between May 25, 1748 and July 23, 1752. Deliveries into the Post Office from out of town were listed, letter by letter, by the names of the addressees, weight and amount due, paid or free. Outgoing mail was simply listed by number of sheets and weight, not by individual letters.

  The records were kept during Benjamin Franklin's tenure as Postmaster of Philadelphia. 
  
## What these datasets are not
