Data description:
Dataset A contains the bulk of the data derived from this book. Each row has been assigned a numerical ID to allow sorting while preserving the data's context.

Dataset B consists of totals by category and weight, written at the bottom of each page of the volume. This data was separated from Dataset A during the transcription process.

All measurements of weight appear in pennyweight (abbreviated Dwt.) and grains (abbreviated Grs.). This unit of mass ("Troy weight") was commonly used in Great Britain until 1878. One dwt. is equal to 24 grs.

Damage and Lost Data:
Because some of this volume's pages are damaged or missing, special care has been taken to allow users to filter out incomplete data if they so wish. Each row in Dataset A indicates the completeness of the data (complete, partial, or lost). Obscured or missing values are indicated by the text string "null" in both datasets. Damage to the page is also described in the Transcriber's Notes column of Dataset A.

Assumptions:
Dittos (Do.) are silently corrected and assumed to refer to the information in the above row. Where there was a missing date in Date of the Bills Received column, it is assumed to be an excluded ditto. The only exception is when the letters received are from a Ship; Ship letters are never given a date of receipt in this volume. This volume was unbound, and page order has been assumed based on inference of logical date progression.

Normalization and Data Standards:
Date is separated into year, month, date. Offices' names are generally not normalized, unless damage, foxing, and ink stains make some letters difficult to interpret. Dataset A was run through OpenRefine and light cell clustering was performed.
