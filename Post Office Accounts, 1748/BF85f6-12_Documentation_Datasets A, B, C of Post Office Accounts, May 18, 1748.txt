Abstract: "'Post Office Accounts' May 18, 1748, is the continuation of the above ledger [Philadelphia Post Office Record Book No. 3, B F85f6.11c]. It contains 68 unnumbered pages. Per the Franklin Papers (vol. II, p. 180-181), 'the amounts owed by each [name-entry] correspond[s] to the subtotals entered in May 1748 in the ledger described above as No. 2 [B F85f6.11b, Philadelphia Post Office Ledger, No.2].'"'

Data description:
Dataset A (Entries) contains the bulk of the data derived from this book. Each row has been assigned a numerical ID to allow sorting while preserving the data's context.

Dataset B (Page Totals) consists of totals by monetary amount, written at the bottom of each page of the volume. This data was separated from Dataset A during the transcription process.

Dataset C (Calculations) contains arithmetical calculations of monetary amounts from pages 39, 50, and 64 of the ledger. These sums correspond to totals found in Dataset A. This data was separated from Dataset A during the transcription process.

Measurements of currency ("Amount due" columns) are likely listed in Philadelphia's local currency rate (which was based on an item's weight). Although also measured in pounds, shillings (abbreviated d.), and pence (abbreviated p.), Philadelphia's currency was not equivalent in value to British Pounds Sterling. Robert Siegel Auction Galleries suggested a 167% inflation factor to convert Pounds Sterling into Philadelphia currency (see https://siegelauctions.com/2007/944/944.pdf page 172). Additionally, prior to 1971, monetary amounts in Great Britain were calculated differently than they are today, so care must be taken with calculations in converting contemporary values to their equivalent modern ones. Prior to that time, Â£1 = 20s. = 240d.

Assumptions:
Dittos (Do.) are silently corrected and assumed to refer to the information in the above row.

Normalization and Data Standards:
Date is separated into year, month, date. Addressee names are separated into tile, first, and last name. They are generally not normalized, unless damage, foxing, and ink stains make some letters difficult to interpret. Dataset A was run through OpenRefine and light cell clustering was performed. The following columns are augmentations of the original data that incorporate information from the "Notes" field: "Paid (pd.)/Delivered (d. or dd.)?", "Amount Paid Pounds:Shillings:Pence".
